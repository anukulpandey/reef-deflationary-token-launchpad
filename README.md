# Deflationary Token Launchpad

Hey Folks! This is a Decentralised Web-application [Dapp] üí∞ built on top of **Reef Chain** where you can launch your own tokens without any coding experience. Not only that, you will be able to customise your token to full extent by choosing its Name, Symbol , Initial supply and the most important parameter Fees. (How much percentage of the token will be burnt). Basically you can deploy Deflationary tokens. What is it? Well... A deflationary token is the token which experiences deflation rather than inflation, i.e over time, it becomes more valuable unlike most of the currencies out there.
